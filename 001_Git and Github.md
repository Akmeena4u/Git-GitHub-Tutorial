### Introduction to Git and GitHub

**Git** is a version control system that helps you track changes to your files and collaborate with others. It manages your code's history and allows you to merge changes from different branches. Don't worry if terms like "version control," "branches," and "merges" are new to youâ€”we'll cover them in this tutorial.

#### What is Git?
- **Git**: A free, open-source version control software used to track changes in your files. It can be installed on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

#### What is GitHub?
- **GitHub**: A web-based platform that hosts Git repositories. It allows you to store, share, and collaborate on code with others. While GitHub is popular, it's not the only platform that hosts Git repositories.

### Understanding Version Control Systems

**Version control systems** are tools that help you manage and track the history of your code. They allow multiple people to work on the same project without overwriting each other's changes.

- **Example**: Think of version control as checkpoints in a video game. You can save your progress, go back to any previous checkpoint, and continue from there. Similarly, in software development, you can track and revert changes in your code.

#### History of Version Control
- Before Git, developers used tools like SCCS (Source Code Control System), which were proprietary and not very user-friendly.
- Git was created to provide a more accessible and user-friendly version control system.
- Other common version control systems include Subversion (SVN), CVS, and Perforce.


### Installing Git

To install Git:
1. **Visit the Git website**: [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
2. **Choose your operating system**: Download the installer for Windows, macOS, or Linux.
3. **Follow the installation instructions**: Complete the setup process.

### Creating a GitHub Account

To use GitHub:
1. **Sign up for an account**: Visit [GitHub](https://github.com) and create an account.
2. **Link your GitHub account to your machine**: This involves setting up SSH keys for secure authentication (covered later in the tutorial).
