# Git Rebase and Reflog

## Rebase in Git

### What is Git Rebase?

Git rebase is a powerful Git feature used to change the base of a branch. It allows you to move a branch to a new starting point by “replaying” the commits from the original base onto the new base. This is useful for maintaining a cleaner, linear project history.

### Why Use Rebase?

- **Cleaner History**: Keeps the commit history linear and easier to understand.
- **Non-disruptive**: Makes changes to the code without affecting the original branch.

### Merge Commits

A merge commit combines two or more commits into one. It is created when merging branches into a single branch. The merge commit includes all changes from the original branches, helping to keep project history clean and easy to understand.

### Using Rebase

Here's a step-by-step example of using `git rebase`:

1. Ensure you are on the branch you want to rebase:
    ```sh
    git checkout feature-branch
    ```

2. Rebase the feature branch onto the main branch:
    ```sh
    git rebase main
    ```
    This replays the commits from `feature-branch` on top of the latest changes in `main`.

3. Resolve any conflicts:
    If there are conflicts, resolve them manually using a merge tool in your IDE (e.g., VSCode).
    ```sh
    git add <resolved-files>
    git rebase --continue
    ```

### Caution

Avoid using the `--force` option with rebase, as it can cause issues with the project history.

## Git Reflog

### What is Git Reflog?

Git reflog is a command that shows the history of your commits. It allows you to see the changes made to your repository over time, which is useful for debugging and understanding project history.

### Viewing Reflog

To view the reflog:
```sh
git reflog
```
This command displays the history of your commits, with each entry numbered.

### Finding a Specific Commit

To find a specific commit:
```sh
git reflog <commit-hash>
```

### Recovering Lost Commits or Changes

If you accidentally delete a branch or lose changes, you can often recover them using the reflog. Follow these steps:

1. Find the reference to the commit where the branch or changes existed:
    ```sh
    git reflog
    ```

2. Reset your branch to that reference:
    ```sh
    git reset --hard <commit-hash>
    ```
    Or use `HEAD@{n}` to reset to the nth commit before the current one:
    ```sh
    git reset --hard HEAD@{1}
    ```
